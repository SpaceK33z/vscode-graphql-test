Install with `yarn` and open using vscode with the prisma vscode plugin.

Open `frontend/test.js`.

## Expectation

I expect that after hitting enter underneath "id" and typing "em", it would show autocompletions for "email" and "emailConfirmed" (see `schema.graphql`).

## Reality

No autocompletions.
